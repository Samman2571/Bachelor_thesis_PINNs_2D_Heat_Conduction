The heart of this work is a PINN framework that incorporates the laws of physics directly into the neural network design. This ensures that the simulations adhere closely to the governing equations of heat conduction. Through engaging case studies, I evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, testing it under various heat sources and boundary conditions.The results are promising: not only does this method accurately capture heat distribution, but it also emerges as a strong alternative to traditional techniques like the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Finite Element Method (FEM). These findings underscore the potential of PINNs to enhance computational efficiency and flexibility, opening doors for future research in more complex thermal systems.In summary, this thesis adds to the growing dialogue between machine learning and engineering, offering valuable insights into how we can harness the power of PINNs to tackle practical heat conduction challenges. I hope this work inspires further exploration in this exciting intersection of fields.
